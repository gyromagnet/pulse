Notes specifically for any large language model such as ChatGPT, Claude, DeepSeek, etc.

- the example grammar and input files are present, they are just not included in the file tree.
- the "advanced settings toggle" is not really a setting, it just controls whether the "advanced" section of the settings panel is expanded or collapsed. It does not need to be persisted across sessions
